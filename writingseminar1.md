3. Several metrics able to provide useful results based on the structural
system requirements can be applied before sending change requests to
suppliers.

1. In this paper, we present two most applicable ones to embedded
automotive software systems – one based on modules’ complexity and one
based on modules’ coupling.

6. We also explain that the measurement results should be compared through
different system releases (with focus on the difference between the current
and future release) in order to be able to capture the size and potential impact
of changes.

4. Since our metrics should be applied in the early stages of the development
process (before sending change requests to suppliers) where not many
behavioral properties of the system are known, they are mostly focused on
structural system properties such as inter-module communication [4].

5. Still, they can identify early which parts of the system will be affected by
changes which can significantly reduce the production cost as well [4].

2. Finally, we suggest how to interpret their results in order to come to the
correct conclusion which should imply the future steps towards securing the
desired quality.


Intended audience
=================

My intended audience is a Computer Science student with an interest in
languages and in particular type systems. Some with a lot of functional
programming experience, and hopefully have seen some dependently typed
programming before. Ideally someone who is enrolled in MPALG and have taken Types for
Programs and Proofs.
