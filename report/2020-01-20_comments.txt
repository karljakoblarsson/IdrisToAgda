* "Idris, Agda, ATS, F* and Epigram are some of the most used": Epigram is _not_ one of the most used.
  It is not even listed in the "Comparison of languages with dependent types" table here:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type

* p3: "attempts of a making" ??
* p3: you use three different styles for "head" within 10 lines of text. Don't.
* p3: You start with "One specific difference" but go on to describe what is common for most of the paragraph. Restructure.
* p5: A number-citation like [8] should be an additional explanation (an annotation) of a working sentence, not replace normal words (names) or phrases. Rewrite or change citation style.
* p5 "translat": spelling
* Avoid writing "of course", "obvious", etc.
